# What is TurboX?

TurboX is a support library for libGDX based projects that provides common
utilities that you might need during the development of this game using this
library. Actually, it's just the common library I use for my games, but made
public to the community.

# How to start using TurboX?

The easiest way to start learning about TurboX is checking out our
[Wiki](https://github.com/danirod/turbox/wiki), where articles and documentation
on the features for this library will be provided. You can also take a look at
the [Javadoc](http://www.danirod.es/turbox/javadoc) for the complete API
reference.

This library is published as a Maven artifact in the Open Source Sonatype
Repository Hosting service (OSSRH) in the snapshots repository. To use the
latest development version in your project, add the following dependency:

  ```gradle
  compile 'es.danirod:turbox:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
  ```

Or if you prefer the Maven artifact:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>es.danirod</groupId>
    <artifactId>turbox</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

At the moment TurboX is on early development and I don't suggest making big
